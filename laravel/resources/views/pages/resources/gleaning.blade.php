    <h2>Gleaning</h2>
    <p>Gleaning volunteers collect leftover crops from farmers' fields after they have been commercially harvested or on fields where it is not economically profitable to harvest. This food is then either processed for or delivered to 40+ local shelters, meal programs, and social service agencies in Kingston.</p>
    <p>Volunteers drive or carpool to a local farm or garden to harvest produce. Produce is weighed at the end of the shift, delivered to Loving Spoonful&rsquo;s Little Cat Cold Storage, and the delivery details are recorded on the track sheet there.</p>
    <p>Gleaning occurs in the harvest season, August to November. A one-time commitment is all that is required. Equipment is provided. No training or experience necessary, but this will involve light physical labour and occasional heavy lifting.</p>
