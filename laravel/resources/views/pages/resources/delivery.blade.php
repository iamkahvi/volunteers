    <h1>Fresh Food Delivery</h1>
    <p>Fresh Food Delivery drivers are responsible for picking up donated surplus food from restaurants, grocers, caterers, and farmers&rsquo; markets and delivering it to local shelters and meal programs to get it to people experiencing hunger.</p>
    <p>Regular routes are available weekly, or you may sign up to cover one-time routes on an occasional basis. If you are delivering food by car, you will need a valid driver&rsquo;s license and regular or occasional access to a vehicle. If you are using a bike to deliver food you will need access to a bicycle; large bike trailer or the willingness to attach one to your bicycle and a backpack, panniers, and/or basket for transporting food.</p>
    <p>You will need:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>An account on the <a href="robot.boulderfoodrescue.org">Food Rescue Robot</a> (sign up for region=Loving Spoonful)</li>
    <li>Route details (time, locations, route order, any special instructions)</li>
    <li>A scale for weighing donated food (in pounds (lb))</li>
    <li>A Loving Spoonful car magnet (while supplies last)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You will receive training in-person or by phone before your first shift. Delivery drivers are responsible for arriving at all pick-up destinations on time and loading donated food into your vehicle. All donated food must be weighed (in lbs) and entered into the Food Rescue Robot online. You will receive training on how to do this and a bathroom scale to use if you don&rsquo;t have one.</p>
    <p>Food must be sorted through at the point of pick up, and any food that you would not feed to your family can be discarded by the food donor.</p>
    <p>When delivering food, offer each drop-off location to take what they like. They will typically not need all of it. In this case, move onto the next location. We design delivery routes to ensure that each agency receives adequate donations. If you&rsquo;re delivering to Fresh Food Market Stands, leave as much as you like, since they aren&rsquo;t staffed.</p>
    <p>If you cannot cover your shift for any reason, either temporarily or permanently, please schedule an absence on the Robot or inform the Food Access Animator as soon as possible, at least 3 days before your shift.</p>
    <p>Be mindful of the safe lifting and safe driving tips below. This position requires some light physical labour and occasional heavy lifting. You will be working without supervision, but will be able to discuss any concerns with the Food Access Animator.</p>
    <h3>SAFE LIFTING TIPS</h3>
    <p>Some of the volunteer roles require lifting heavy objects. Improper lifting techniques can potentially lead to various back injuries. Here are a few simple tips about how to lift heavy objects safely:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Always begin with your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with one foot slightly ahead of the other.</li>
    <li>Squat down, bending at the hips and knees only. Do not attempt to lift by bending forward.</li>
    <li>Look straight ahead, and keep your back straight, your chest out, and your shoulders back. This helps keep your upper back straight while having a slight arch in your lower back.</li>
    <li>Slowly lift by straightening your hips and knees (not your back). Keep your back straight.</li>
    <li>Hold the load as close to your body as possible, at the level of your belly button. Never lift a heavy object above shoulder level.</li>
    <li>Be careful not to twist your body as you lift or hold a heavy object. Use your feet to change direction, taking small steps.</li>
    <li>Lead with your hips as you change direction. Keep your shoulders in line with your hips as you move.</li>
    <li>Set down your load carefully, squatting with the knees and hips only.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>SAFE DRIVING</h3>
    <p>When picking up or dropping off donations, always remember these tips:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Some of our pickups and drop offs take place in locations where parking can be difficult. If stopping in a no parking zone, indicate that you will only be there temporarily, make sure to leave your four way lights on. Make sure you return to your vehicle as quickly as possible</li>
    <li>Make sure to keep your Loving Spoonful magnets displayed at all times.</li>
    <li>In the winter, the cold weather can make the magnets stiff, causing them to fall off. It may be best to leave them on your dashboard instead.</li>
    <li>Always obey all traffic rules.</li>
    <li>Never put speed or efficiency above your own safety, even if you are running late.</li>
    </ul>
