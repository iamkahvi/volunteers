    <h3>Criminal Record Check (CPIC)</h3>
    <p>Volunteering in the GROW Project and Community Kitchens often involves working with vulnerable populations including children, people with intellectual disabilities and people experiencing mental illness.  For that reason, a current criminal records check (CPIC) with a Vulnerable Sector check is required for all new volunteers participating in these programs. The document must be current within 2 years of the date of your volunteer application. CPICs are not required to volunteer with any other Loving Spoonful program, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
    <p>Your CPIC can be obtained by visiting the local police department. Loving Spoonful does not keep the original CPIC on file, but a Loving Spoonful staff person must see it. A scanned copy or photo of the document is acceptable. So long as you are an active volunteer in GROW Project and Community Kitchens, a yearly declaration will be requested to confirm that the status of the CPIC has not changed.</p>
    <p>If you are able to cover the cost of your CPIC, that is appreciated as it allows our budget to provide more programming.  If you are able to do so, Loving Spoonful can provide a tax receipt for your donation if you request one. If you would like Loving Spoonful to reimburse the cost of the CPIC ($30), please submit the receipt from your payment.  Loving Spoonful will reimburse your expense after you have completed five (5) volunteer shifts in one of these programs.</p>

    <p>Volunteers must not attend their volunteer shift while under the influence of drink or drugs. To do so will be cause for instant dismissal. Volunteers must not take drugs or drink during their shift at Loving Spoonful.</p>
