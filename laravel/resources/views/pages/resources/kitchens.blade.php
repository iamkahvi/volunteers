    <h2>Community Kitchens</h2>
    <p>Community Kitchen Volunteer Assistant Instructors help the Community Kitchen Instructor in leading healthy cooking classes with groups of people of all ages at various locations in the City (e.g., Kingston Community Health Centres, Princess Street United Church, etc.). Classes vary from 2-4 hours in length. Shifts can be during the day, evening, or weekends. Volunteers can commit to either one-off or regular volunteer positions (such as a 4 &ndash; 6 week cooking series). Cooking programs run between September and June each year. Note that Community Kitchen positions are limited, so please sign up for another volunteer role with Loving Spoonful in case we are unable to fit you into the kitchen.</p>
    <p>A training meeting will be set up at the start of each cooking program as required. The Community Kitchen Instructor will review details about the cooking participants and volunteer position, as well as the recipes and activities that will be used during the workshops. This meeting will either take place before the program begins or directly before the first shift at the kitchen.</p>
    <p>The Community Kitchen Instructor will provide support to the volunteer. Supervision will take place to make sure recipes are being followed (within reason) and people are having fun.</p>
    <p>Community Kitchen volunteers will:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Assist in leading a small group of participants through the workshop recipes;</li>
    <li>Engage with participants in a fun and encouraging way;</li>
    <li>Help with set up, clean up, and workshop activities required; and</li>
    <li>Read the recipe in advance, and give feedback about the class as required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It&rsquo;s essential to allow the participants to do most of the cooking. Volunteers are there as support, and while they can show participants how to chop/measure etc. in ways that are safe and time efficient, it&rsquo;s important they don&rsquo;t take over and do the task themselves (even if they can do them &lsquo;better&rsquo;).</p>
    <p>A non-judgemental and respectful approach is always required when working with cooking participants, ensuring participants feel welcomed, included, and dignified.</p>
